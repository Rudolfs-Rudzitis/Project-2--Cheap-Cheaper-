# #2-"Cheap Cheaper"
"Cheap Cheaper" takes the price of an particular item on Amazon & sends an email if it drops below a
particular price. It checks the price once a day. Made using "BeautifuSoup", "Requests", "SMTPlib" to enable
emailing myself once the price drops and "Time" to make the app run once a day
