# #2-"Cheap Cheaper"
"Cheap Cheaper" is an app that scrapes the price of an particular item on Amazon & sends an email if it drops below a particular price. App checks the price once a day. Made using Python library "BeautifuSoup", also used "Requests", "SMTPlib" to enable emailing myself once the price drops and "Time" to make the app run once a day.
